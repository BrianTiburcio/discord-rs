## Who we are

## Status

**discord-rs** is in it's very early infancy and is not yet usable. However, we will be working eagerly to get us to a functional state.

You can keep up to date with development of this crate on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/RT4q6Y7Xkh) as well as receive one-on-one help from either maintainers or other members of the community regarding best-practices, questions or anything else related to this package.

## Features

- Blazingly Fast!
- Intuitive.
- Multi-Threaded.
- On the bleeding-edge (This library uses [Discord's v10 Gateway API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#api-versioning) which at the time of this being written is the latest version).

## Getting Started
